<!-- WIP -->

The [Thousand Contributors Programme](https://github.com/w3f/1KC) is an initiative maintained by Web3 Foundation's
Technical Education and Support team to offer an off-chain contributor program to support and reward community 
contributions. The program focuses on rewarding contributors in the areas of technical education, community, and support 
that relate to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.
